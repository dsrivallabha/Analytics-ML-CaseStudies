The precious white metal skyrocketed by around 180% in 2025 due to the rising demand-supply constraint. The precious bullion rose after industrial demand increased following Samsung's announcement to transition from lithium-ion batteries to solid-state batteries.\\n\\nSome structural changes, such as disruptions in export supply from Peru and Chad due to escalating tensions between the US and Venezuela, and China's shadow ban on silver exports from January 1, 2026, also lent support at lower levels after the profit-booking trigger. However, some experts have now suggested that investors holding long positions in silver should consider booking a profit and exiting their positions.\\n\\nAccording to market experts, the silver rate today has climbed to \", '', 'Photo : ET Now Digital\\n\\nVenezuela Crisis: Traders are carefully monitoring how oil, gold, silver, and copper prices respond to the US actions in Venezuela.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVenezuela Crisis: The question of whether gold, silver, and other asset prices will go up has gained attention after the US conducted military strikes in Venezuela and captured President The question of whether gold, silver, and other asset prices will go up has gained attention after the US conducted military strikes in Venezuela and captured President Nicolas Maduro .

Fuelled by traditional hard assets like gold and silver posting returns not seen since the late 70s, the narrative is shifting from incremental gains to exponential leaps. But is it just hopium, or is there a logical framework to support these audacious claims?\\n\\nThe core argument revolves around XRP’s potential to not just compete with, but to dwarf, the established value held in precious metals. Influencer Chad Steingraber ignited the conversation, stating that XRP will “obliterate metals by 10x.” While seemingly hyperbolic, the underlying logic rests on comparing market capitalisations and projecting XRP’s potential role in a future global financial landscape.
