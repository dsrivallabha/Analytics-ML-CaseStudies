So, we set\n","out to evaluate GPT3 on a set of planning instances derived\n","from the domains typically used in the International Plan-\n","ning Competition (IPC) –including the well known Blocks\n","World†. Our results13were contrary to the anecdotal claims\n","about the planning abilities of LLMs, and when we made\n","them public, received significant attention in the AI circles.\n","By the beginning of 2023, with the wide-spread public re-\n","†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks world\n","1arXiv:2403.04121v2  [cs.AI]  8 Mar 2024lease of ChatGPT, and later, GPT4, there were a slew of ad-\n","ditional claims, including in refereed papers, about LLM’s\n","abilities to reason and plan. So we decided to repeat our\n","tests on both GPT3.5 and GPT412. Initial results showed\n","that there was some improvement in the accuracy of gen-\n","erated plans from GPT3 to GPT3.5 to GPT4, with GPT4\n","reaching 30% empirical accuracy in the Blocks World (al-\n","beit still lower in other domains). We then wanted to know\n","whether the modest improvement is because of the im-\n","proved approximate retrieval abilities or whether GPT4 is\n","actually doing/searching for plans.\n","Let us pause to note that my interest here is not whether\n","LLMs can fake reasoning (by giving correct answers to\n","reasoning tasks from memory and pattern finding), but\n","whether they can actually do principled reasoning. Of\n","course, seeing patterns in reasoning problems is not any-\n","thing to be sneezed at. After all, our interest in master-\n","ing it is what is behind much of “street fighting” math\n","(e.g. George P ´olya’s ”How to Solve it”). But finding ap-\n","proximate shortcuts over provably correct reasoning proce-\n","dures is obviously not equivalent to doing reasoning–unless\n","you have an ability to establish from first principles that\n","your hunch is actually correct. It is challenging to decide\n","whether a system (or a human, for that matter) is memoriz-\n","ing or solving a problem from scratch–especially as the sys-\n","tems (or humans) get trained on larger and larger “question\n","banks.” This is a challenge that most instructors and inter-\n","viewers are acutely aware of. Think of that infamous “Why\n","are manhole covers round?” interview question. While it\n","may well have given the interviewer an insight into the\n","candidate’s analytical reasoning skills the very first time it\n","was asked, all it does with high probability now is to con-\n","firm whether the candidate trained on the interview ques-\n","tion banks!\n","Considering that the LLMs don’t suffer some of the nor-\n","mal limitations of humans–such as having a life on the\n","side, and thus not having the time or inclination to focus\n","exclusively on the test/interview preparation for long peri-\n","ods, they can support approximate retrieval over webscale\n","corpora. My research group wanted to check if the im-\n","proved performance of GPT4 is because of approximate re-\n","trieval from a larger training corpus, or really comes from\n","its ability to plan. One way of checking this for planning\n","tasks is to reduce the effectiveness of approximate retrievalby obfuscating the names of the actions and objects in the\n","planning problem. When we did this for test domains12,11,\n","GPT4’s empirical performance plummeted precipitously,\n","despite the fact that none of the standard off-the-shelf AI\n","planners have any trouble with such obfuscation.‡\n","Perhaps they can’t do planning autonomously straight out\n","of the box, but can they do it with a little nudge? There\n","are broadly two popular techniques for such nudging. The\n","first, called “fine tuning,” is rather straightforward: take a\n","general LLM and fine tune it on planning problems (i.e.,\n","instances and their solutions), with the hope that they will\n","subsequently make better guesses (see the left-hand side\n","of Figure 1). While our own limited experiments didn’t\n","show any significant improvement through fine tuning, it\n","is possible that with even more fine tuning data and ef-\n","fort, the quality of LLM guesses may well improve. But\n","all that such fine tuning is doing is converting the planning\n","task into a memory-based approximate retrieval (akin to the\n","memorization/compilation from System 2 to System 1; see\n","Figure 1). It doesn’t prove that LLMs are able to plan.\n","The second way to improve planning (and reasoning) per-\n","formance is to prompt an LLM back with hints/suggestions\n","about how it can improve its initial plan guess. The crucial\n","questions here are (a) whether this back prompting is man-\n","ual or automated (b) who is certifying the correctness of the\n","final answer and (c) whether the prompts inject additional\n","problem knowledge or are just merely exhorting the LLM\n","to try again.\n","The cleanest approach–one we advocate12,6–is to let an ex-\n","ternal model-based plan verifier do the back prompting and\n","to certify the correctness of the final solution. In general,\n","such LLM-Modulo frameworks6can gainfully leverage the\n","amazing idea generation capabilities of LLMs with sound\n","external verifiers in a generate-test-critique framework with\n","gurantees.\n","In contrast, by far the more popular methodology is to\n","have the human in the loop prompt the LLM iteratively.\n","The problem with this is that it is highly susceptible to the\n","‡As these results came about at the height of sparks of\n","AGI/existential risk angst, we couldn’t resist the tongue-in-cheek\n","editorializing that if GPT4 ever goes rogue, you can stymie it by\n","throwing a simple planning problem at it! Humor aside, nothing\n","in our studies showed that GPT4 is capable of generating exe-\n","cutable plans autonomously.\n","2Figure 2. Claimed reasoning capabilities of LLMs are sometimes\n","due to the subconscious helpful iterative prompting by the humans\n","in the loop (graphic adapted from https://xkcd.com/2347/ under\n","Creative Commons License)\n","Clever Hans effect§, where the LLM is merely generating\n","guesses, and it is the human in the loop, with the knowledge\n","of right vs. wrong solutions, who is steering the LLM–even\n","if they didn’t set out to do so deliberately. The credit and\n","blame for the ensuring accuracy, if any, falls squarely on\n","the human in the loop. The relevance of such a frame-\n","work becomes questionable when the human-in-the-loop\n","doesn’t know (or is unable to verify) the answer to the rea-\n","soning/planning problem themselves. Thus the tongue-in-\n","cheek characterization of LLM reasoning abilities in Fig-\n","ure 2.\n","A variation on the second approach is to have the LLM it-\n","self “critique” the guesses it generates and iteratively self-\n","improve. Although some papers seem to swear by such a\n","“self-improvement” capability of LLMs, the plausibility of\n","such a claim hinges on the belief that the LLMs are bet-\n","ter at verifying their solutions than they are at generating\n","them. While never explicitly justified, the assumption rests\n","§https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever Hanson either analogies to humans or indirect nods to compu-\n","tational complexity arguments. While humans sometimes\n","do show the capability of correcting their own erroneous\n","guesses with self-critiquing, there seems to be no basis for\n","that assumption in the case of LLMs. And while for many\n","computational tasks (e.g. those in class NP¶), the verifica-\n","tion is often of lower complexity than generation, that fact\n","doesn’t seem particularly relevant for LLMs which are gen-\n","erating (approximately retrieving) guesses, rather than ac-\n","tually solving the problem with guarantees. Indeed two re-\n","cent studies from my lab–one on plan verification10and the\n","other on constraint verification9–seem to throw cold water\n","on this optimism by showing that with “self-verification”\n","performance actually worsens. This is because LLMs hal-\n","lucinate both false positives and false negatives while ver-\n","ifying the solutions they generate. One reason this is not\n","recognized in earlier literature is that there self-verification\n","claims are often made in the context of tacit knowledge\n","tasks for which there is little possibility of a verifier (e.g.\n","writing/improving essays), making it harder to evaluate\n","whether LLM’s critiquing actually helped. Paradoxically,\n","the fact that it is infeasible to write sound verifiers for tacit\n","knowledge tasks also makes it easier to mistake LLMs for\n","being as reasonable a critic as any!||In other cases, an ex-\n","ternal simulator winds up playing the role of sound verifi-\n","cation.\n","While the foregoing questions the claims that LLMs are\n","capable of planning/reasoning, it is not meant to imply that\n","LLMs don’t have any constructive roles to play in solving\n","planning/reasoning tasks. In particular, their uncanny abil-\n","ity to generate ideas/potential candidate solutions–albeit\n","with no guarantees about those guesses–can still be valu-\n","able in the “LLM-Modulo” setups6, in conjunction with\n","either model-based verifiers or expert humans in the loop.\n","The trick to avoiding ascribing autonomous reasoning ca-\n","pabilities to LLMs is to recognize that LLMs are generating\n","potential answers that still need to be checked by external\n","verifiers.\n","The skeptical reader might now ask: But what about all\n","¶NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial , and covers the\n","class of computational problems whose solutions can be verified\n","in polynomial time.\n","||In other words, LLMs can be as good as that Peloton instruc-\n","tor in confidently critiquing Christopher Nolan movies.\n","3those papers at high profile AI conferences that claim to\n","show planning abilities of LLMs? To analyze those claims,\n","we need to first understand that solving planning tasks re-\n","quires (a) having the necessary planning domain knowl-\n","edge–the actions and their preconditions, effects; the stan-\n","dard hierarchical recipes (e.g. task reduction schemas in\n","Hierarchical Task Network planning), past cases/plans etc.\n","and (b) being able to assemble this knowledge into an ex-\n","ecutable plan that takes care of any subgoal/resource inter-\n","actions. The first can be called the knowledge acquisition\n","part, and the second reasoning/planning part. Many of the\n","papers claiming planning abilities of LLMs, on closer ex-\n","amination, wind up confusing general planning knowledge\n","extracted from the LLMs for executable plans. When all we\n","are looking for are abstract plans, such as “wedding plans,”\n","with no intention of actually executing said plans directly,\n","it is easy to confuse them for complete executable plans.\n","Indeed, our close examination of several papers claiming\n","planning capabilities7for LLMs suggests that they either\n","are evaluating in domains/tasks where subgoal interactions\n","can be safely ignored, or delegating the interaction resolu-\n","tion (reasoning) to the humans in the loop (who, through\n","repeated prompting, have to “correct” the plan). Some-\n","times, in common sense domains, or with enough fine tun-\n","ing, the “assembling” part may also be obviated by having\n","seen a case that pretty much corresponds to the problem\n","that needs to be solved. Without these assumptions or mit-\n","igations, the plans that come out of LLMs may look rea-\n","sonable to the lay user, but lead to execution time interac-\n","tions and errors. These issues are illustrated in part by a\n","recent news story about the proliferation of travel planning\n","books8, mostly auto-extracted from LLMs, and the ensu-\n","ing disappointment of the unsuspecting end users who buy\n","them mistaking them for usable plans!\n","The fact that LLMs are often good at extracting planning\n","knowledge can indeed be gainfully leveraged. As we have\n","argued in recent work1, LLMs can be a rich source of\n","approximate models of world/domain dynamics and user\n","preferences, as long as the humans (and any specialized\n","critics) in the loop verify and refine the models, and give\n","them over to model-based solvers. This way of using LLMs\n","has the advantage that the humans need only be present\n","when the dynamics/preference model is being teased out\n","and refined, with the actual planning after that being left to\n","sound frameworks with correctness guarantees6.\n","Figure 3. Viewing LLMs as an approximate knowledge source\n","trained over civilizational knowledge\n","Such a framework has striking similarities to knowledge-\n","based AI systems of yore, with LLMs effectively replac-\n","ing the “knowledge engineer” (Figure 3).

So the million dollar question for reasoning\n","tasks becomes: “how would you do planning if you have\n","some doddering know-it-all ready to give you any kind of\n","knowledge?” The LLM-Modulo framework6is a princi-\n","pled method for tackling this challenge.\n","To summarize, nothing that I have read, verified, or done\n","gives me any compelling reason to believe that LLMs do\n","reasoning/planning, as normally understood.
